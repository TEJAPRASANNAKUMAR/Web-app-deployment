# Automated Web-application-deployment
#Description:
"The Automated Web Application Deployment project demonstrates the use of modern DevOps practices to enhance the efficiency and reliability of deploying web applications. By automating the build and deployment processes, developers can focus more on writing code and less on managing infrastructure, resulting in faster release cycles and improved software quality."
#Benefits:
->Automation: Reduces manual effort and potential errors in the deployment process by automating tasks.
->Consistency: Ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production through containerization.
->Scalability: Utilizes cloud services to scale the application based on demand.
->Collaboration: Facilitates collaboration through version control and shared repositories.
